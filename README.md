# Cadmus Img Shell

❗ **OBSOLETE**: this library is obsolete. For an example of using Cadmus image annotation bricks in an Angular app, see the [Cadmus CHIGC app](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-chgc-app). Each project provides its own image annotations part, as it deals with a specific model. Yet, this part can be built by just assembling bricks. The project is kept here because when adding new components to the imaging bricks it could be a shell for their test. Eventually, the current annotations library in this project will be implemented on the model of CHIGC, and be up to date again.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

Cadmus imaging components shell. This was derived from Cadmus shell, by moving here imaging-specific components which require additional dependencies.
